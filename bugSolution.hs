The solution is to provide a more sensible default value instead of `undefined`:

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

data :: Maybe Int
data = Nothing

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = fromMaybe 0 data -- Use 0 as the default value
  print result
```

This version replaces `undefined` with `0`. Now, when `fromMaybe` receives `Nothing`, it returns `0`, and the program runs without errors.  Alternatively, we can use a pattern match:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = do
  case data of
    Just x -> print x
    Nothing -> print 0
```
This approach explicitly handles both the `Just` and `Nothing` cases, avoiding the use of `undefined` altogether.
