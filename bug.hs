This Haskell code attempts to use `undefined` in a way that isn't immediately flagged by the compiler, leading to runtime exceptions:

```haskell
import Data.Maybe

data :: Maybe Int
data = Nothing

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let result = fromMaybe undefined data
  print result
```

The `fromMaybe` function takes a default value and a `Maybe` value. If the `Maybe` value is `Nothing`, it returns the default value.  In this case, we're using `undefined` as the default. This compiles without error, but when `main` is executed, it will throw a runtime error because `undefined` is accessed.
